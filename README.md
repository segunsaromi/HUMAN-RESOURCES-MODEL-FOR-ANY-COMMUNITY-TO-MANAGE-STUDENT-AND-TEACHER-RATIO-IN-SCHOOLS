# HUMAN-RESOURCES-MODEL-FOR-ANY-COMMUNITY-TO-MANAGE-STUDENT-AND-TEACHER-RATIO-IN-SCHOOLS
This is a simple PHP programme that manages the teachers and student in any school. The administrator can add schools, add teachers and assign teachers to school.. If the student/teacher ratio is inbalance, the administrator will be notified from the dashboard in order for him to be able to do necessary adjustments when needed.

With this programme you can manage the student and teacher population in any school added.
