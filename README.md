# HUMAN-RESOURCES-MODEL-FOR-ANY-COMMUNITY-TO-MANAGE-STUDENT-AND-TEACHER-RATIO-IN-SCHOOLS
This is a simple PHP programme that manages the teachers and student in any school. The administrator can add schools, add teachers and assign teachers to school.. If the student/teacher ratio is inbalance, the administrator will be notified from the dashboard in order for him to be able to do necessary adjustments when needed.

With this programme you can manage the student and teacher population in any school added in order for theire not to be less teachers or more students for qualitative educational system. 

Firstly i will suggest you upload the sql file. Remove .sql extension and the remaining is the database name you can use to create the database after which you should upload the sql file in there. The database has some test data but you can creat yours while using the application.

I used root and no password. So for the purpose of this application testing you can create a database with root and no password.

Secondly create a folder and name it whatever you want, only remeber that the name will constitute the url for accessing the application from your browser. Upload the two folders into the folder you created and thats all.

I have not yet created the module to add admin so i added admin login detail manually from the database and you can find it in users table. The password i used is "asdfghjkl".

This application allows you to create schools, teachers and standard used in measuring the teacher/student ratio.

You can also edit teachers, assign teachers to school or reassign teacher to another school.

You can edit the standard and activate the standard you want to use in measuring up the student/teacher ratio. but remember to deactivate the previous standard activated so that the application will use the new standard activated.

Through the dashboard you can get the state of techer/student ratio in any school added. if it shows "red", then there is deficeit of teachers; if it shows "amber" then there is surplus of teacher and if it shows "green" there is balance between student and teacher, all this is dependent on the standard ratio you have activted in the application.

This application has lots more features and there are lots more feature i want to add to it but at the moment i am busy with other development and would visit it soon.

Please note:  I have been playing around this code since last month and hope to put perfection on it like connect file usage, commenting and using more functions to minmize coding.
